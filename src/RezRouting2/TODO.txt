[ ] Routes should contain reference to route and resource

[ ] Test routes in isolation

[ ] Register routes in correct order, e.g. avoid clashes

[ ] Suggestion: CollectionBuilder should have 2 configure actions, one for collection, one for item?

[ ] Resolve route creation dependency on Resource - does it need access to resource or just a context object?

[ ] RouteTypeBuilders, with common functionality, e.g. map route with this action

[ ] AspNetMvc.BuiltInRouteTypes.Crud

[ ] ControllerScanner - automapping based oncontroller hierarchy

[x] RouteMapper entry point as in RezRouting

[x] Full routebuilder configuration (methods, actionnames etc)

[x] Actually create the MVC routes
