[ ] Standardise terminology for built-in route type schemes, is it TaskRouteScheme or CrudRouteTypes

[ ] Configure inflector overrides

[ ] Route types should be passed all controllers and return sequence of routes, to allow them to select single controller etc.

[ ] AutoResourceMapping - automapping based on controller hierarchy

[ ] CollectionBuilder - configure singular item name

[ ] Add nested resources to CrudRouteTypeTests

[ ] Support action name override

[ ] Demo app - add some comments

[ ] Back to standard namespace

[ ] Refactor: Test structure

[ ] Refactor: CollectionBuilder should have 2 configure actions, one for collection, one for item?

[ ] Refactor: Resolve route creation dependency on Resource - does it need access to resource or just a context object?

[ ] Refactor: Automatic singular CollectionItem name convention should be done outside of builders, e.g. conventions independent of builders

[ ] Refactor: Null object pattern for root parent resource
