[ ] Suggestion: CollectionBuilder should have 2 configure actions, one for collection, one for item?

[ ] End to end route mapping tests with fake http context etc

[ ] Resolve route creation dependency on Resource - does it need access to resource or just a context object?

[ ] Extract IXConfigurator from XBuilder (IBuilder is IConfigurator without the Build method)

[ ] Validate UrlPath for invalid characters or trim invalid characters

[x] Configure types handling routes - HandledBy

[x] Introduce RouteTypes 

[x] Add Routes to Resource model

[x] Collection item structure

[x] Share code between collection and singular

[x] Customize URLPath

[x] New UrlSegment to encapsulate differences in behaviour, e.g. straight directory name, id etc.

[x] Resource UrlPath

[x] Collection id param configuration

[x] Configuring items twice should not create 2 child resources

[x] Warning as error

[x] Nested collections, should use different id for ancestors

[x] CollectionItem name should be singular name version

[x] UrlPath correct term for singular / collection builders. DirectoryPath instead?

[x] Collection id param as ancestor configuration

[x] RouteMapper entry point as in RezRouting

[x] Full routebuilder configuration (methods, actionnames etc)

[x] Actually create the MVC routes

[x] Route urls

[x] RouteBuilder, add single Configure method, more concise than setting props?
