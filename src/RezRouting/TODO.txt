 
[ ] Standardise terminology for built-in route type schemes, is it TaskRouteScheme or CrudRouteTypes

[ ] Url generation using expression trees (separate project as has dependency on MvcFutures)

[ ] Route types should be passed all controllers and return sequence of routes, to allow them to select single controller etc.

[ ] AutoResourceMapping - automapping based on controller hierarchy

[ ] CollectionBuilder - configure singular item name

[ ] Add nested resources to CrudRouteTypeTests

[ ] Support action name override

[ ] Demo app - add some comments, explanations and readme

[ ] Example of using resources to generate breadcrumb navigation in demo apps

[ ] Resource.Data - arbitrary information attached to model, such as user friendly titles, whether to include in navigation etc, menu display order etc

[ ] Comments on public API

[ ] Basic performance test, determine impact of large number of routes on inbound / outbound URL-mapping

[ ] Force push with reset history to master

[ ] Refactor: Test structure

[ ] Refactor: CollectionBuilder should have 2 configure actions, one for collection, one for item?

[ ] Refactor: Resolve route creation dependency on Resource - does it need access to resource or just a context object?

[ ] Refactor: Automatic singular CollectionItem name convention should be done outside of builders, e.g. conventions independent of builders

[ ] Refactor: Null object pattern for root parent resource

[ ] Convention: Using singular name for item-level controller namespace can lead to conflict between ns and class name
