[ ] Refactor: Test structure

[ ] Refactor: CollectionBuilder should have 2 configure actions, one for collection, one for item?

[x] Refactor: Null object pattern for root parent resource (new base level)

[x] Add basepath to RouteMapper, e.g. /api or /admin - similar - could add special Root or Base resource.

[x] CollectionBuilder - configure singular item name ItemName

[x] Resource.Data - arbitrary information attached to model, such as user friendly titles, whether to include in navigation etc, menu display order etc

[x] Separate RezRouting.AspNetMvc 

[x] Include arbitrary data in Resource model

[x] Include arbitrary data in Route model

[x] Resource.Ancestors - all parents

[x] Back to standard namespace

[x] URL generation

[x] Apply path formatting options to route types

[x] Task routes

[x] Task routes demo 

[x] Demo app - bootstrap

[x] AspNetMvc.BuiltInRouteTypes.Crud

[x] RouteTypeBuilders, with common functionality, e.g. map route with this action

[x] Full name on routes

[x] Register routes in correct order, e.g. avoid clashes

[x] Test routes in isolation

[x] Routes should contain reference to route and resource

[x] End to end route mapping tests with fake http context etc

[x] Configure types handling routes - HandledBy

[x] Introduce RouteTypes 

[x] Add Routes to Resource model

[x] Collection item structure

[x] Share code between collection and singular

[x] Customize URLPath

[x] New UrlSegment to encapsulate differences in behaviour, e.g. straight directory name, id etc.

[x] Resource UrlPath

[x] Collection id param configuration

[x] Configuring items twice should not create 2 child resources

[x] Warning as error

[x] Nested collections, should use different id for ancestors

[x] CollectionItem name should be singular name version

[x] UrlPath correct term for singular / collection builders. DirectoryPath instead?

[x] Collection id param as ancestor configuration

[x] RouteMapper entry point as in RezRouting

[x] Full routebuilder configuration (methods, actionnames etc)

[x] Actually create the MVC routes

[x] Route urls

[x] RouteBuilder, add single Configure method, more concise than setting props?
