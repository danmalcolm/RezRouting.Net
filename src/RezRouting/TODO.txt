First - Final tweaks to API to minimise change
-----

[ ] Publish to nuget

[ ] Wiki

[ ] Have base RootResourceBuilder rather than specialised ResourcesBuilder - needs some kind of consolidation

[ ] clear index cache after mapping mvc resources


Next
----

[ ] AutoResourceMapping - convention-based automapping based on controller hierarchy

[ ] Demo app - add some comments, explanations and readme

[ ] * routes, e.g. all action methods on a resource's controllers, attributes?

[ ] Separate support for MVC 4

[ ] Refactor: Test structure

[ ] Refactor: Resolve route creation dependency on Resource - does it need access to resource or just a context object?

[ ] Advanced Demo: Breadcrumb nav based on ResourceModel, auto-mapping, searching on index, separate base controllers

[ ] MVC tests slow (5-6s) - due to mocks? Create FakeHttpContextBase impl?

[ ] Detect clashes between id param names within hierarchy, e.g. if same name used by ancestor

[ ] Global conventions applied to all resources, e.g. comments. 

[ ] Customise id param of parent resource for specific route, e.g. adding comments route might change productId to parentObjectId

[ ] Additional custom RouteData in routes

[ ] Consider using a single MVC route based on entire resources model? Better support for large number of resources and faster inbound/outbound resolution of routes at end of colleciton


Done
----

[x] Slight refactoring of conventions, e.g. convention passed to ResourcesBuilder, no need for extra build step

[x] don't use route conventions in tests when simple routes can be set up

[x] Introduce IHandler and IRouteHandler to replace controller type and controller-type.action - more framework neutral 
- not everything uses controller classes, e.g. functional style for newer frameworks

[X] Change entry point name, e.g. resource builder

[X] Separate namespaces for Configuration and Resources - easier to understand project structure and roles?

[X] Comments on public API

[X] Custom routes for any resource, not just based on RouteConventions

[X] Validate path URLs at configuration time for valid characters

[X] When mapping MVC routes, check if name is already used and throw with informative exception

[x] Bug: Word separator should be_inserted_between letters and numbers

[x] Support action name override when scanning for supported actions

[X] Clean up cached actiondescriptors used during MVC route creation

[X] Performance - repeated use of actiondescriptors etc.

[X] Bug: If resource name ends with number NRE occurs

[X] Bug: NRE if inflector can't guess singular - default to <CollectionName>Item?

[X] Basic performance test, determine impact of large number of routes on inbound / outbound URL-mapping

[X] ResourceUrl<T> helper variation

[x] ASP.Net MVC Areas support

[x] Improve MVC (and future frameworks') route registration API - simple extension method

[x] Introduce ResourcesModel class - better to pass this around than a collection of resources?

[x] Update NuGet / build (and MVC assembly binding issues)

[x] Back to MVC 5.2.0.0

[x] Force push with reset history to master (lose first attempt)

[x] Standardise terminology for built-in route type schemes (builders - will allow tweaks)

[x] Refactor: Null object pattern for root parent resource (new base level)

[x] Add basepath to RouteMapper, e.g. /api or /admin - similar - could add special Root or Base resource.

[x] CollectionBuilder - configure singular item name ItemName

[x] Resource.Data - arbitrary information attached to model, such as user friendly titles, whether to include in navigation etc, menu display order etc

[x] Separate RezRouting.AspNetMvc 

[x] Include arbitrary data in Resource model

[x] Include arbitrary data in Route model

[x] Resource.Ancestors - all parents

[x] Back to standard namespace

[x] URL generation

[x] Apply path formatting options to route types

[x] Task routes

[x] Task routes demo 

[x] Demo app - bootstrap

[x] AspNetMvc.BuiltInRouteConventions.Crud

[x] RouteConventionBuilders, with common functionality, e.g. map route with this action

[x] Full name on resources

[x] Full name on routes

[x] Register routes in correct order, e.g. avoid clashes

[x] Test routes in isolation

[x] Routes should contain reference to route and resource

[x] End to end route mapping tests with fake http context etc

[x] Configure types handling routes - HandledBy

[x] Introduce RouteConventions 

[x] Add Routes to Resource model

[x] Collection item structure

[x] Share code between collection and singular

[x] Customize URLPath

[x] New UrlSegment to encapsulate differences in behaviour, e.g. straight directory name, id etc.

[x] Resource UrlPath

[x] Collection id param configuration

[x] Configuring items twice should not create 2 child resources

[x] Warning as error

[x] Nested collections, should use different id for ancestors

[x] CollectionItem name should be singular name version

[x] UrlPath correct term for singular / collection builders. DirectoryPath instead?

[x] Collection id param as ancestor configuration

[x] RouteMapper entry point as in RezRouting

[x] Full routebuilder configuration (methods, actionnames etc)

[x] Actually create the MVC routes

[x] Route urls

[x] RouteBuilder, add single Configure method, more concise than setting props?

[x] Extract IXConfigurator from XBuilder (IBuilder is IConfigurator without the Build method)

[x] Add options, e.g. path formatting etc

[x] Path formatting options

[x] Id name convention
